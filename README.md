# histopathology image caption

A dataset of 262,777 patches extracted from 991 H&E-stained gastric slides with Adenocarcinoma subtypes paired with captions extracted from medical reports. For more details see [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9gKn7SDb83v).


[captions.csv](captions.csv) contains `id,subtype,text` columns, where `id` designates the whole slide image id from which the patches were extracted. The patches filenames have `id` in the prefix as follows:  `{id}_{random hash}.jpg`. The patches can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G3jGR-1EXX_ykeIcYw6KIIDNskxmME6m/view?usp=sharing).
